#Map instructions for Quake maps (by Chuma)

Usually i like to work with p2p and file sharing software so it can be easy to track all releases, changes, feedback and such... What do you need for running my Quake map?

1. A sourceport ( i use Ironwail)
2. Re Mobilized latest version (this map is being made for rm 1.1)
3. Allocate these folders in the library.


Map name : RE:2m6 The Dismal Oubliette.

## Installation of this map from Github

I'll focus on one thing only the manual download but Github have several ways for you to remotely stay on par with the project remotely. (i won't go in detail on how to install the mod or Quake, this is a dev site of the map so yeah uwu, in any case i can point out how to)

1. Click on the green button called "Code".
2. Click on "Local" altho by default you would be there
3. Download Zip

There you go, you have downloaded the whole map... it's a bit hidden but it's a dev thing.

Alternate ways to download the project that aren't manual.

- If you are in windows download Github Desktop and in "Code" just associate this project with the desktop settings, each time i fetch an update (or pushed an update) you will have the project on hand.

- If you are on the cmd or are cmd developer pro console command mlg, you can just clone the repo using commands by having already git/Github on your computer, it should update automatically without any issue.

This will change when the map is release, thank you for your patience, have a cookie and thank you for playing my map :)
