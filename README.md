## Requirements

This map requires the mod Re Mobilized 1.1 mod for Quake.

You can download the version of the jam as that would be the final and official, this one will be the source from my end or any micro patch.

Just download the source file (go to code and Download as ZIP) and download all files into your rm1.1 folder (this even depends how the folder it's named on your end) so well, that's it.
## The making of the maps and Facts

### About the map (the making of)
Re Mobilized is the mod i had the most fun making a map so far... the progs dump features and the mechanics of Re:Mob are the best you can get to at least play Quake's Edge/ Apex Quake / Quake Legends, you name it...well there you go.

Per se my original idea was about to make a map about a Sci-Fi structure where you would end up climbing and get steps by steps up and finishing in a spaceship that would lead to a future Alkaline map, regardless this was a bit too much of a big idea... having played almost all Re:Mob maps, Spootnik's map of RE:1M8 gave me an idea... pick an already existing id1 map and make it Re:Mobilized , sounds cool right?

I was between The Grisly Grotto and The Dismal Oubliette... i picked Dismal Oubliette or E2M8 due to the fact it was a very open map, add the cut entrance, and add to the fact i wanted to add some original sections, it was the perfect candidate for my idea.

Since the beginning i started with the idea of adding to the map while keeping the best of it and making small changes... i used some Q2 textures since both games are now canon, perfectly enough!.

And since the beginning i split in paper the sectors or areas with code names... this helped me up in the end since my computer couldn't handle the complete shown map and i took some time to split the layers.

In the middle of the making of the map i added an iron lung easter egg, since as a small change i wanted all the water to be red/ blood water, Forte said : You know you could add a small submarine... at first i wanted to add an osciloscope but Forte insisted on making the whole Submarine, i asked him to do it since i was already busy with the core of the map, but i made the whole area... Forte is an exceptional mapmaker and friend, he is awesome and i give him credit for making the submarine, and along the way i asked David Szymanski (Duskdev) about the Submarine easter egg and if i could use an original track of Iron Lung, all of the answers were yes (at this time dm7sp was released, first Copper experiment).

Towards the end i really grounded a bit my desires for the map, i had a lot of ideas i had to ground, remake and rethink, i had a small emotional slope (nothing to do with Quake Mapping or Quake ofc), i planned 3 entryways and a sky secret in the Dismal Oubliette core map, but the sky secret became the iron lung secret easter egg, and the 3 new areas were just direct puzzles to use the new custon key entity that i reduced to just 2.

The elevator part was in regards the most affected by this "grounding" but it kinda went how it expected to be.

Also the best toy was using delay -1 in the enemies to add some RNG, alongside Path_corners (some made by me and some others made by John himself), another favorite toy was the spawn of triggers or "is_waiting", really cool made me happy along the way!

### Facts

- This is the map i least used spawn triggers comparing it to my old previous maps, altho they are still used just in a Serious sam way.
- Sunlight color is yellow and the fog is red, originally it was the other way around, but the sky didn't look well enough so i switched it.
- Most of the original map and spawns is the way it is, since it's strong in combat and area, altho i added some monster encounters and original areas, obvious remark but important.
- As of the previous point, it was a fun nod how the elevators in the second part of the oubliette worked because the other existed... i wouldn't have expected that!
- I cleaned all the id1 trigger spawns and made it more directly as it has been done in mods recently, because there were small chances of them not activating and locking the player from getting 100% kills.
- The map is mainly playtested and made for Nightmare but it can be completed in any difficulty!
- Due to the changemusic feature i wanted to split the map in micro-chapters but i discarded the idea, it seemed a bit far fetched.
- Trigger_changemusic can be passed over and change the current track anytime, this never let anyone change the original track in any form... so i left in the spawn a trigger_changemusic, Forte suggested a some sort of music jukebox but i prefer to leave it like this.


### Composed fact
If you REALLY think about the tracks tell a story that encompasses the map (the White bat audio tracks):
- "Infernal Sky" (the start track) you can see that Ranger is entering a "different" universe Oubliette, one of the first thing he perceives while looking right is the sky, that is red (the sky was left at the suggestion of my friend Aluna since it really fit).
- "Alien Crypt" (the track in the entrance) talks about how Ranger is yet to enter the dungeon but it's a crypt of some sort, not alien tho, just an Eldritch one.
- "Lost in the matrix" (the track in the oubliette) basically Ranger is lost in this familiar but rather bit different dungeon, with the same objective, getting the rune.
- "Embers" (the final track before the ending) Ranger knows it's close to the Ember, the powerful Rune of black magic... So this is the final track that symbolizes how close he is to his objective.
- "Ghostlight" by David Szymanski speaks how Ranger is confused and it's seeing a Submarine in the middle of nowhere, in what it appears to a dimensional jump, provided with a powerful LG, someone helped our hero in the journey giving him the weapon a bit in advance (if he was fortunate to find it).

The story of the map is just Ranger arrives to find The rune of black magic, somehow what he feels is an scenario he somehow recognizes it's different, but has a familiar feel (if it can be implied he has maybe saved Earth from Shub-Niggurath many times), as he gets deep into it he completes the deed knowing he got it and that other worlds await to be explored!

- I didn't plan that to be the story that was me kinda having a theory since the track with the names fit... you can actually ignore it if you like, it's just me storywriting randomness heh.

## Installation of this map from Github (OLD JUST FOR DEV AND TESTING)

I'll focus on one thing only the manual download but Github have several ways for you to remotely stay on par with the project remotely. (i won't go in detail on how to install the mod or Quake, this is a dev site of the map so yeah uwu, in any case i can point out how to)

1. Click on the green button called "Code".
2. Click on "Local" altho by default you would be there
3. Download Zip

There you go, you have downloaded the whole map... it's a bit hidden but it's a dev thing.

Alternate ways to download the project that aren't manual.

- If you are in windows download Github Desktop and in "Code" just associate this project with the desktop settings, each time i fetch an update (or pushed an update) you will have the project on hand.

- If you are on the cmd or are cmd developer pro console command mlg, you can just clone the repo using commands by having already git/Github on your computer, it should update automatically without any issue.

This will change when the map is release, thank you for your patience, have a cookie and thank you for playing my map :)
